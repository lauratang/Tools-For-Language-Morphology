Code for language documentation and analysis: storing lexical entries with senses

Part of a larger project: Documenting Endangered Languages with WordEye Linguistics Tool
from abstract
WordsEye Linguistics Tool (WELT) to study endangered languages. WELT is a tool under development for eliciting endangered language data and formally documenting a language, based on WordsEye (Coyne and Sproat, 2001), a text-to-scene generation tool that produces 3D scenes from text input. First, a linguist uses WELT to create elicitation materials and collect language
data. Next, he or she uses WELT to formally document the language. Finally, the formal models are used to create a textto-scene system that takes input in the endangered language and generates a picture representing its meaning.
